## Building Neural Networks with PyTorch.
- Using Pytorch for building simple to complex NNs including Transfer Learning.

1. pytorch.py - Consists all the basic and important PyTorch functions, essential to begin with.
2. pytorch-autograd.py - PyTorch's state of the art differentiation feature (gradient calculations) and it's implementation.
3. pytorch-Tpipeline.py - Emulating a typical Training Pipeline for Deep Learning projects by building a very simple neural network. No use of standard functions, self written model, forward, loss, backprop and evaluation functions.
